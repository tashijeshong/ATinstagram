             "Today was amazing. I hiked the hardest trail I‚Äôve ever been on. It was so challenging and kind of life changing‚Ä¶ if that makes sense‚Ä¶ so many realizations and moments of becoming emotional because of what I have overcame in the last few years. I‚Äôm so proud of myself.",
             "Yesterday was one of the hardest days I‚Äôve had on trail. After starting south from Stehekin, I immediately started feeling sharp pain in my left knee after stretching and taking ibuprofen. Going into a 110 mile stretch with no bailout options just didn‚Äôt feel right. I decided to say goodbye to my trail family and head back to Stehekin. The plan is to get off trail until I can figure out what‚Äôs going on with this injury, even if that means putting it off a year. In just over a week, I met some incredible people and saw some pretty wild things. Crash, Long Way, Piglet, and Donuts - thanks for the miles and the extra push here and there. I‚Äôm stoked to see you reach Mexico! Until next time PCT. I‚Äôll be back very soon‚úåÔ∏è"
